# P25Master-Dashboard
A WIP Dashboard for multiple P25Reflector talkgroups/servers

##This is NOT ready for any sort of live use and is nowhere near complete.

The goal of this project is to create a master dashboard that will pull in stats from several P25Reflector servers/talkgroups.
With the docker library it would also be possible to enable things such as shutdown/restart of talk groups on the fly or even create new ones from the web interface.

Currently talk groups I have set up are all done by hand and a remote .txt file on a server updates the MMDVMs with the groups.

The template for this is based off of https://github.com/afourmy/flask-gentelella
